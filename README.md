This is my submission for Mission 0 of the advanced software developer accelerator at Mission Ready. I have taken the wireframe examples and created a responsive webpage that has been themed as a store homepage for a tabletop gaming/hobby supply shop and community hub.
Built With
React.js
NPM
Font Awesome
Google Fonts
Adobe Express

Getting Started
I used Visual Studio Code IDE to develop my React App and imported fonts and icons from Google Fonts and Font Awesome. Adobe Express was used to resize images before importing them into the app as uniform sizing made it much easier to style the page.

Prerequisites
This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.

npm
npm install npm@latest -g
Installation
Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/WDuncker/40kWorld-mission-0.git
Install NPM packages - npm install
Enter your API in config.js

Usage
This page, for me, is used to show some basic skills on the React.js frontend framework and some examples of conditional redering and responsive web design. In future this could be used as a boilerplate framework for a storefront homepage with the only major changes being to images, text content and colour scheme.
